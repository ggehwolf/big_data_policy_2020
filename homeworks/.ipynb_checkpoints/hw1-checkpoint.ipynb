    "The objective of the following homework is to **bring to practice the tools studied in class** by conducting step by step a first big data project. We advise that you do it in parallel with the lectures: the relation between the project steps and the lectures is indicated below. \n",

    "You will build several **machine learning models that will predict continuous and categorical variables based on data coming from webscraping and/or an API**. \n",

    "We propose that you predict the **daily stock price data of a large company** (of your choice) **based on the company's tweets**. You can chose a company from one of the [major stock indices](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/List_of_stock_market_indices). \n",

    "**Step 1a: `X` variables** [week 2]\n",
    "- Fetch the data using the **twitter API** or any other API or website that you are interested in.\n",
    "- Beware of the rate limits and organize your program so as to overcome them if needed\n",
    "- The data should include some text, but might also have other interesting variables (retweets, favorites...)\n",
    "- Create some (non-text based) `X_num` variables that you will use for the prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1b: continuous `y` variables** [week 2]\n",
    "- Fetching the data: \n",
    "    - if you work on the suggested idea, you can easily access daily stock prices using the [`yfinance` package](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/)  (see below)\n",
    "    - otherwise, you can find some interesting data listed in the syllabus\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1c: merge `X_num` and `y`** [week 2]\n",
    "- Beware of the temporality: in the case of the proposed study on stock market prices, you will have to deal with the fact that the X is at the tweet level while `y` is daily. \n",
